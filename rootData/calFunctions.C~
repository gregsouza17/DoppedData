    - TH1D in a fout with charge, sample
    and Searcher Samples

    What Should:

    - Go thorugh every file for a certain channel
    - For each event, get the peaks at the last 1000 entries
    - If the peaks is isolated and agreeable as by the Searcher,
    add the peak to a sample histogram,
    and the charge to a charge histogram
    - Add the possibility to save a number of searcher samples
